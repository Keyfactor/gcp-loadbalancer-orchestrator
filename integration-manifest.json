Inventory, Management-Add, and Management-Remove functions are supported.  Also, re-binding to endpoints IS supported for certificate renewals (but NOT adding new certificates).  The orchestrator uses the Google Cloud Compute Engine API (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1) to manage stores."
